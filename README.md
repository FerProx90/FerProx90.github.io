## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use of CSS variables and flex-box due to know how to use it and the way this CSS attributes works. 

### Continued development

I'll be keeping forward with all knowledge left to learn, having a better control of flex-box and grid displays.
Also learning web design with coding lenguages like Javascript to be a Front-end Developer
